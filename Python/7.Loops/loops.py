# LOOPS
# ==================================================================
# A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
# This allows us to do repeated tasks in a controlled manner


# To test our loops, some values :
num_max   = 10
counter   = 0

#... and some lists
name_list = ["Marcel", "Mary", "Dolores", "John"]
num_list  = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
letters   = "Python"



# LOOPS ANATOMY
# -------------------------------------

# for item in name_list:
#   print(item)

# for name in name_list:
#   print(name)


# THE WHILE LOOP
# while counter < num_max:
#   counter += 1
#   print(counter)


# while True:
#   if(counter <= num_max):
      
#       print(counter)
#       counter += 1


# while counter <= num_max:
# counter += 1
# print(counter)
      # if(counter > 0):
      
      
      # else:
      #   continue


# LOOPS TESTS
# =============================================
# for num in range(1, 10 + 1):
# print(num)





# Alternatively, if we want a specific amount of loops
# We can use range(num)
# for x in range(10):
#   print(x)


# WHILE: This loop repeats the executing the code while the condition remains true
a = 3
b = 8
# while (a != b):
#   print("Still true!")
#   a += 1


# FOR: This loop is used to go through a list (array) of items
# x is a placeholder name that will be replaced with the item of an array
list_of_items = [5, 8, "Hello", 7]
# for item in list_of_items:
#   print(item)



# LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS
# ==================================================================
# BREAK: will exit the current loop entirely
# count = 1
# while True:
#   if count <= 10:
#     print(count)
#     count += 1
#   else:
#     break
  




# CONTINUE: will skip the current loop and start the next loop
# for x in range(12):
#   # Checking if x is an even number
#   if x % 2 == 0:
#     continue
#   print(x)




# MISCELLANEOUS
# ==================================================================
# ELSE: This can be used to execute code when the loop finishes
y = 0
# while(y):
#   y+=1
# else:
#   print("Work done!")
